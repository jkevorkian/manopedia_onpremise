   * Refine `TranslationEngine`: The current TranslationEngine is very basic. You'll need to implement more
     sophisticated logic to interpret the FloatArray output from the TFLite model into meaningful
     translations, potentially incorporating the sliding window logic for sequence prediction.
   * UI Enhancements: Improve the user interface to display the translated text clearly and provide user
     controls (e.g., start/stop translation, switch cameras).
   * Comprehensive Unit Tests:
       * `DataPreprocessor`: Write tests to ensure correct landmark extraction, normalization, and sliding
         window behavior.
       * `TFLiteModelHandler`: Write tests to verify model loading and inference with sample input data.
       * `TranslationEngine`: Write tests to ensure accurate interpretation of model outputs into translated
         text.
   * Error Handling and Permissions: Implement robust error handling for camera access, model loading, and
     inference. Handle runtime permissions for the camera.
   * Performance Optimization: Profile the application to identify and address any performance bottlenecks,
     especially in the preprocessing and inference steps.
